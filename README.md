# decimal-convertion

Problem Statement:Program to Convert Decimal to Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal

Solution:  Decimal to Binary
-> Pass the argument decimal number in the function

-> The condtion to check the number is greater than or equal to 1

-> Call the recursive function for floor division of the number

->display number % 2

-> Call the function

Solution: Decimal to Hexadecimal
-> Pass the argument decimal number in the funtion

-> call the method hex(number) and store it to the variable

-> display the variable

Solution: Decimal to Octal
-> Pass the argument decimal number in the funtion

-> set the variable value =1 and octnum=0

-> While the number is not equal to 0

-> set variable remainder as number%8

-> variable octnum = octnum + remainder * value

-> set value = value * 10

-> set number = number //8

-> Display the octnum

-> Call the function
